MapStruct: Browser-based experiment software for investigating human cognitive map structure
=============

![logo](mapstructurelogo.png)

MapStruct is research-grade software for running psychological experiments in the browser, intended to investigate the structure of spatial memory. The map-like representations that support human spatial memory are fragmented into sub-maps, rather than being unitary and global.

MapStruct has originally been developed to facilitate a series of experiments by (Madl et al., submitted), arguing that cognitive map structure can be explained by a process of clustering (grouping together objects that are close in some feature space). It is made freely available here for academic (non-commercial) use.
