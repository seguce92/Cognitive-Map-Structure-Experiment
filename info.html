<p>This 3D virtual reality experiment aims to find out how humans structure&nbsp;representations of space.</p>

<p>You will see a simple 3D environment, and instructions on the right - something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://madlnet.net/tsworks/scrnshot.png" /></p>

<p>You will have to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Walk around and look around in the environment, using the keys<sup>*</sup> W, A,&nbsp;S, D and your mouse,&nbsp;and <strong><u><em>memorize&nbsp;the positions, and names, of the buildings</em></u></strong>.&nbsp;In some cases you will also have to pick up a package from one building (stand near it and press E), and deliver it to another (<span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">stand near it and press E</span>).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Press enter when you have memorized the positions (and delivered the package if asked to). The environment will vanish.</li>
	<li><em style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Create a map</em> of where you remember the buildings by dragging them into their correct place with your mouse.</li>
	<li><em><strong><u>Recall the names of all buildings</u></strong></em> you have seen a few times, starting with different buildings. <strong>It is sufficient to remember and recall the first word of the building names</strong> - for example, if you see "John's house" and "Clothes shop", you can just enter "John" and "Clothes".</li>
</ol>

<p>There will be two experiments, with experiment 1 containing 15 and experiment 2 containing 5 tasks, for a total of 20 tasks. Each task should take about 3 minutes (~1 minute for memorization and delivery, and ~2 minutes for recalling the map and the names of the buildings). Thus, the experiment will take approx. 1 - 2 hours, depending on the number of breaks and mistakes made. (You can take breaks any time you wish).</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><small>W to move forward, A to move left, S to move right, D to move back. Move the mouse to change where you look, like in a first-person computer game. Press Esc at any time to pause the experiment. If you don&#39;t see any buildings, press Esc and then click the &quot;Reset current task&quot; button. If you would like to move faster, press Shift.</small></p>

<div class="panel-heading"><strong>Participant Information Sheet</strong></div>

<div class="panel-body">You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide it is important for you to<br />
understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the<br />
following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please ask if there is<br />
anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not<br />
you wish to take part. Thank you for reading this.</div>

<div class="panel-body"><strong>Who will conduct the research?</strong><br />
MSc Tamas Madl<br />
<strong>Title of the research.</strong><br />
Factors influencing the structure of spatial representations<br />
<strong>Why have I been chosen?</strong><br />
Voluntary participants have been recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk.&nbsp;No reason for non-participation is required.<br />
<strong>What would I be asked to do if I take part?</strong><br />
This study is part of a PhD project and will help understand how humans remember maps of<br />
environments. It will involve navigating 3D virtual environments on your computer (in your<br />
browser),&nbsp;playing delivery&nbsp;games, creating maps, and recalling buildings. It will consist of two<br />
experiments and take about an hour in total. Sitting in front of a computer for too long can<br />
cause minor discomfort; but you can take a break at any time you wish.<br />
<strong>What happens to the data collected?</strong><br />
The data will help understand which properties are important for structuring spatial maps of<br />
environments, and how important they are relative to each other. All data will be used and stored<br />
in accordance with University policy.<br />
<strong>How is confidentiality maintained?</strong><br />
Confidentiality will be maintained by Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participant data will be anonymous.<br />
<!--<strong>Will I be paid for participating in the research?</strong><br />
Participants will receive 1.5 USD&nbsp;compensation for their time.<br />-->
<strong>What is the duration of the research?</strong><br />
Approximately 45 minutes, without breaks.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Where will the research be conducted?</strong><br />
Anywhere participants wish; on their own computer, in their browser.<br />
<strong>What if I change my mind?</strong><br />
Participants are free to leave the study at any time, without giving a reason.<br />
<strong>Will the outcomes of the research be published?</strong><br />
The results of this research will be published in a PhD thesis and, if possible, in an academic journal.<br />
<strong>Something went wrong - I can&#39;t see any buildings!</strong><br />
Try pressing &quot;Esc&quot; and clicking &quot;Reset current round&quot;. (Also, please make sure you use the Google Chrome<br />
browser, version 9 or later. Please note that your computer needs to have a graphics card to run this experiment)<br />
